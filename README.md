# Project: Food-4-Philly

# Pitch: 1 in 5 Philadelphians are food insecure. Households may wish to donate to hunger relief organizations but unclear regulations about foods may deter them. Our app helps users easily navigate donation. 

# Long Description: 
Food-4-Philly was built as a tool for individuals, households, and neighborhoods who are motivated to donate surplus food to local community hunger relief organizations. Many people who would like to donate, might be unsure or unaware of the regulations surrounding food donation. What if food is expired? Does the type of packaging matter? Did you know that refrigerated eggs can be donated 23 days after their sell-by date?!

Our app helps to remove confusion surrounding food donation, making donation fulfilling and enjoyable.
Through the interactive dash app, users encounter a series of dropdown menus and buttons to find out if their donations will be accepted. Users that are able to donate can then additionally access distances to the 5 closest food donation locations through Google Maps.

Food-4-Philly is designed specifically for individual and household users. One estimate suggests that US households throw away over 150,000 tons of food each day! But, individuals and households can make a difference!

We believe that if we can make it easier AND more enjoyable for families and individuals to donate their excess household food, we can help to reduce waste and serve our food-insecure neighbors in Philadelphia.

# Food-4-Philly was built with Dash and Python.
